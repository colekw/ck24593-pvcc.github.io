<h1 class="heading"> Definitions</h1>
<p class="paragraph"> A job queue is a mechanism used to manage and execute jobs or tasks asynchronously
FIFO is a method for organizing dat structure by following the rule, first one is, last one out.
Interactive Processing is the continual two-way flow of information between a user and a computer system.
Time-sharing is when multiple users share a single computer system where the users are essentially multitasking together.
Multiprogramming allows simultaneous execution of multiple programs at once withh the primary goal of maximizing CPU utilization and efficiency.
Application Software is referred to as apps. Apps tend to meet the needs of the user and provides a platform for different tasks.
Utility Software is a system software used to perform specific tasks such as antivirus, and or disk cleanup utilites.\
GUI is a type of user interface that allows the user to interact with icons, buttons, windows, etc.
Shell is a command that allows users to interact with an operating system and execute commands. 
Kernel is a core component of an operating system that acts as a link between the hardware and the software applications. 
Device Driver allows an operating system to communicate and control the functions of a hardware device. It acts as the translator which enables the operating system.
File Manager provides a user interface to copy, create, move, or extract files and folders. 
Virtual Memory allows the computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by transferring data from RAM to disk storage. 
Boot Strapping refers to the process of loading and booting up a computer system.
ROM is used primarily in the start up of PC and saves its content even when the power is turned off. The instructions to load hardware is in the ROM.
Deadlock is when two or more processes are unable to start. It occurs whhen two processes are waiting for the other.
Spooling refers to the process where data is stored in a queue or buffer so another device can access it when ready. 
Super User(admin) is the user account with elevated privileges, manages all the user files.
Multi Factor Authentication is a security system that requires the user to provide multiple forms of indentification before being granted accessl
